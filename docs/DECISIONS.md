## ADR-0003: Separate `.venv` per Python app, not a shared one

**Context:** `apps/api` and `apps/worker` are both Python but have different
dependency sets (FastAPI/uvicorn vs. APScheduler) and will diverge further as
each grows.

**Decision:** Each app owns its own `.venv` and `pyproject.toml`, installed
independently. No shared root-level Python environment.

**Consequence:** Slightly more disk/setup cost, but each app's dependency
graph stays legible and CI jobs for api/worker are fully independent (a
worker-only dependency bump can't break the api build). `packages/shared` is
TS-only for the same reason — Python code shares via HTTP/DB, not imports.

## ADR-0002: Dockerized dev Postgres/Redis on non-default ports (5433, 6380)

**Context:** This VPS already runs a native Postgres 16 and Redis (used by an
unrelated `chess` project) on the standard ports 5432/6379. The plan calls for
Postgres+Redis via Docker so `docker compose up` gives a reproducible dev
environment for anyone cloning the repo (a hiring manager included).

**Decision:** `docker-compose.yml` maps Postgres to host port 5433 and Redis
to 6380, leaving the native services on 5432/6379 untouched. `DATABASE_URL`
and `REDIS_URL` in `.env.example` point at the mapped ports.

**Consequence:** No port collision with existing infra. Anyone who clones this
repo elsewhere (no native Postgres/Redis running) still gets working defaults
since the app only ever talks to `localhost:5433`/`:6380`, never the
platform-default ports.

## ADR-0001: Node 20 via nvm, system Node left at 18

**Context:** The plan specifies Next.js 15, which (like the current tooling
ecosystem around it — eslint 9, latest create-next-app) requires Node ≥18.18,
and current `create-next-app`/tooling versions increasingly assume ≥20. The
VPS's system Node is 18.19.1. The VPS also runs a global `pm2` installed
against system Node, which we don't want to risk breaking.

**Decision:** Install Node 20 via `nvm` for the `ubuntu` user rather than
replacing system Node. `apps/web`, `scripts/dev.sh`, the Makefile, CI, and
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` all explicitly `nvm use default`/pin Node 20 rather
than relying on ambient `$PATH`.

**Consequence:** System Node/pm2 stay untouched. Every entry point that needs
Node 20 has to source nvm explicitly (documented in `CLAUDE.md`) — a fresh
non-login shell will otherwise silently pick up system Node 18 and things
will fail in confusing ways (e.g. `create-next-app` refusing to run, or a
subtly different eslint/typescript resolution).
